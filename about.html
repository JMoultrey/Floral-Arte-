    <p>   Located in lovely Madera, we have opend up our new floral shop. Born and raised in Mexico, my family moved to America when I was 12 years old. With Spanish being my first language it was difficult at first to make friends and communicate effectively, but one thing my parents taught me was to never give up and work hard! I studied hard and learned the language and from there it was time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. <br> <br>
    As I got older and completed high school, I started working in production. I was very passionate about my position and moved up in the company quickly but I knew that was not where my heart is. <br> <br>
    Growing up I also had a passion for gardening. I would help my parents out in the yard and with the landscaping and after a while my mom relied on me to plant the flowers. I started to become really good at color schemes, flower types, what looks good together and what doesn't and it sparked something in me. I began arranging flowers into bouquets for decoration around the house until one day mi tia said " Why don't you sell these, poeple would pay for these kinds of arrangements." So I began selling bouquets to locals and clients on Instagram until we saved enough to get our own shop! <br><br>
    Now, I am my own business owner and do what I love  the most to do. When your doing something you love, you will never work another day in your life!
